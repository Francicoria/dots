# dots
hi, these are my dotfiles!

Other than the ascii wallpapers (that are from [SystemThirtyTwo](https://gitlab.com/SystemThirtyTwo/ascii-wallpapers)), all of the wallpapers are made by me in Inkscape(most of them are traced images taken from various places on the internet).

If you are interested in the svgs file for the wallpapers take a look at [this repo](https://gitlab.com/francicoria/vectorart).
